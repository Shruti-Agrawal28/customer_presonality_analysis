# Customer Personality Analysis Machine Learning Model

This machine learning model is designed to analyze customer data and predict personality traits based on that data. The model uses a variety of techniques, including natural language processing, clustering, and classification, to identify patterns in customer behavior and determine their personality characteristics.

## Getting Started

To use this machine learning model, you will need a dataset of customer data. The data should include information such as customer demographics, purchase history, and customer feedback. The more data you have, the better the model will perform.

### Prerequisites

To run this machine learning model, you will need Python 3.6 or later, as well as several Python packages, including scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. You can install these packages using pip or another package manager.

### Installing

To install this machine learning model, clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

To use this machine learning model, you will need to train it on your dataset. The `train.py` script can be used to train the model:


streamlit run train.py 


Once the model has been trained, you can use it to predict the personality traits of new customers. The `batch_prediction.py` script can be used to make predictions:


python batch_prediction.py 


## Model Architecture

This machine learning model uses a combination of natural language processing, clustering, and classification techniques to predict customer personality traits. The model is trained on a dataset of customer data, including demographic information, purchase history, and customer feedback.

The natural language processing component of the model is used to analyze customer feedback and identify patterns in the language used by customers with similar personality traits. The clustering component is used to group customers with similar personality traits together, while the classification component is used to predict the personality traits of new customers based on their data.
